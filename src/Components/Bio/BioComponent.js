            I am someone who loves to learn new skills and meet new people.
            Through-out my life I have constantly tried to find a way to improve
            myself and find a skill or trade that I want to do. During this
            journey I have worked as a server, dishwasher, grill cook, kitchen
            manager, manual machinist, cnc machinist, and machine shop manager.
            Each of these roles allowed me to pick up new skills and learn more
            about myself. In time I learned enough about myself to know I was
            not happy in any of these roles. That they just were not interesting
            to me, so I thought to myself long and hard. Asking myself the same
            question over and over {'what do I want to do?'}. The answer was
            obvious I want to program videogames because I love video games.
            Then the answer wasn&apost obvious becuase learning to program games on
            your own is hard as hell. I realized that I need to learn and
            understand more about the world of programming and its nuances
            before tackling a task such as making a game. Which led me to
            NSS(Nashville Software School) I didn&apost think I would ever decide to
            go to school again. School is expensive and being a manager while
            trying to learn a completely new skill sounded terrible (It is very
            terrible). Still I felt like this would make me happier and to be
            honest programming has made me happier. It is one of the most
            frustrating skills I have ever learned in my life but it is so much
            more rewarding than anything else I have ever done.
